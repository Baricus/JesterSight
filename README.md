 A Spelunky 2 True Crown timer that does not require game modification.

This is currently largely a proof of concept; it is barely functional and still has bugs that need to be worked out.  The main one is that Olmec (2nd phase largely) can be considered the true crown causing the system to trigger.   

For the moment, the project is on haitus as I am searching for better methods to accomplish the desired image detection.
